# Python-Minesweeper-WIP-

Minesweeper Programmed in Python

Customisable Grid Sizes, etc. Right click to place flag.

This isn't entirely finished but the game works 100% fine - just want to add a leaderboard and some easter egg when you win, etc.
Wrote this in an hour or two when I was bored on a car trip.

Have fun
